# Deep-Learning-Specialization
Includes all the projects from Andrew's Deep Learning Specialization

Completed all 5 courses of the Deep Learning Specialization:
  - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
  - Improving Deep Neural Networks 
    Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularisation 
    & Optimisation
  - Structuring Machine Learning Projects
  - Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
  - Sequence Models

In this Specialization, built neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, Transformers, and learned how to make them better with strategies such as Dropout, BatchNorm, and Xavier/He initialization. Mastered these theoretical concepts, learned their industry applications using Python and TensorFlow, and tackled real-world cases such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing, and more.
